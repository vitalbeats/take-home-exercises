# Data Science Position
As part of the interview process you will have been asked to work on an exercise. These exercises have been chosen to reflect the day to day tasks of the position you are interview for.

## Exercises
At Vital Beats we build decision support tools that help clinicians detect early signs of disease worsening. This includes making predictions about future outcomes for individual patients.

We have decided to make two exercises available, so you can choose the one that piques your interest.

### Predict No-Show for Medical Appointments
Patients with a cardiac device have to come in to the clinic for regular follow-up meeting. Sometimes they don't show up, which results in a reschedule. This is annoying for both the clinic and patient. [This exercise](./medical-appointment-no-shows/) is about predicting if citizens will show up for their upcoming medical appointment.

### Predicting Future Medical Events
Some patients have a cardiac device because they experience dangerous arrhythmias. The device is there to treat these arrhythmias, but it would be better to avoid them all together. Being able to alert the clinic about patients with high likelihood of an upcoming arrhythmia would enable preventive actions. [This exercise](./predict-future-events/) is about predicting future medical events.
